You are welcome to use it for any purpose without paying me, but see
license.txt for the fine print.

Crypto++ has been compiled successfully with MSVC 6.0 on Windows 2000,
GCC 2.95.2 on FreeBSD 4.1, and CodeWarrior 5.3 on MacOS 8.

To compile Crypto++ with MSVC, open the "cryptest.dsw" workspace file
and build the "cryptest" project. This will compile Crypto++ as a static
library and also build the test driver. Run the test driver and make sure
the validation suite passes.  Then to use the library simply insert the
"cryptlib.dsp" project file into your own application workspace as a
dependent project.

A makefile is included for you to compile Crypto++ with GCC. Make sure
you are using GNU Make and GNU ld. The make process will produce two files,
libcrypt.a and cryptest.exe. Run "cryptest.exe v" for the validation
suite.

Right now there is very little documentation for Crypto++.  If you are
not familiar with cryptography, I suggest that you read an introductory
text (such as Bruce Schneier's _Applied Cryptography_) before attempting
to use this library.  Then, you should start by looking at
cryptlib.h, which contains the main abstract base classes and their
descriptions, and test.cpp, which contains sample/test code.  

Finally, a couple of usage notes to keep in mind: 

1. If a constructor for A takes a pointer to an object B (except primitive
types such as int and char), then A owns B and will delete B at A's
destruction.  If a constructor for A takes a reference to an object B,
then the caller retains ownership of B and should not destroy it until
A no longer needs it. 

2. Crypto++ is thread safe at the class level. This means you can use
Crypto++ safely in a multithreaded application, but you must provide
synchronization when multiple threads access a common Crypto++ object.

Good luck, and feel free to e-mail me at weidai@eskimo.com if you have
any problems.  Also, check http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai/cryptlib.html
